        <h1 class="text-decoration-underline">Events</h1>
        <p>The school organised many events which students can take part in. One of these events was Clean Day. It was my first large scale event in SP and there were many people including adults, workers, students from many different schools and organisations. Cleaning for that day was ceased to show the amount of litter there will be when we go without cleaners. We collected a substantial amount of litter that day.</p>

        <h1 class="text-decoration-underline">Education</h1>
        <p>The Common Core Curriculum (CCC) is designed to prepare us students for a disruptive world that is ever-changing. There are 10 common core modules, comprising critical human and emerging digital skills that will allow us to be versatile and thrive in the future, no matter which industry or job we go into.The CCC also offers us an integral and inter-disciplinary learning experience to address the wicked problems of the world framed by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Through these modules, we will think critically about real-world problems, empathise with local and global communities and be challenged to effect change with the skills we will acquire, to build a better and more sustainable Singapore and world.</p>

        <h1 class="text-decoration-underline">Water Dispenser</h1>
        <p>SP cultivates eco-conscious habits by encouraging students and staff to use water dispensers around campus and have ceased the use of plastic bottled water at events. Plastic bottles contribute significantly to the global plastic waste problem. By reducing the use of plastic bottles, it can help minimize the amount of plastic waste generated.</p>
